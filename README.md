# What is dune-randomfield?

dune-randomfield provides Gaussian random fields based on
circulant embedding, with the following features:
- exponential, Gaussian and spherical covariance functions
- standard vector calculus operations
- multiplication with covariance matrices, their inverse
  and an approximation of their square root
- optional caching of matrix-vector products
- parallelization based on domain decomposition and MPI
- field input and output based on HDF5

# How to use dune-randomfield

dune-randomfield is written as a Dune module. You can put it as
a requirement into the dune.module file of your own module and
configure/build it through dunecontrol (see the documentation
of dune-common for details).

dune-randomfield requires the external library FFTW3 with MPI
support for parallelized circulant embedding, and the external
library HDF5 with MPI support for parallel file I/O. The tested
versions are:
- fftw-3.3.4
- hdf5-1.8.14

Apart from dune-common, dune-randomfield has no dependencies on
other Dune modules, and can directly be used in other scientific
computing environments.

See the automated tests in the /test subdirectory for basic
usage.

# Where to get help

To get help concerning dune-randomfield, first check the
examples in the /test subfolder. These tests can be built by
issuing *"make build_tests"* in the main folder, and run with
*"make test"* or by calling the executables directly.
